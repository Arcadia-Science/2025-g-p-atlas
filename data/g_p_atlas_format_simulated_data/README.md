# Simulated data

This folder contains the simulated genotype-phenotype data from [this publication](https://doi.org/10.57844/arcadia-5953-995f). 

Here, the data are split into Train (80% of data) and Test (20% of data) datasets. These are the data used in [the pub](https://doi.org/10.57844/arcadia-d316-721f) that this repository accompanies.

Note: before running G-P Atlas analysis of these data they need to be decompressed using `gunzip`.
